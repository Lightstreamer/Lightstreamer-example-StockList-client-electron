This project contains a demo application showing the integration between the Lightstreamer JavaScript Client library and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).

![Demo ScreenShot](screen_basicstocklist_large.png)

## Details

This demo displays real-time market data for ten stocks generated by a feed simulator and is based on [Basic Stock-List Demo](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-javascript#basic-stock-list-demo---html-client). <br>
This project shows how is it possible to integrate the <b>JavaScript Client API for Lightstreamer</b> into <b>Electron</b>, in order to quickly create cross-platform desktop apps embedding real-time web technologies.

If you want to go deeper into Electron, check out the [Electron site](https://www.electronjs.org).

## Install

If you want to install a version of this demo pointing to your local Lightstreamer Server, create a local clone of this repository on your computer and follow these steps:

* If you don't have [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) installed on your system, please install it.
* Note that, as prerequisite, the [Lightstreamer - Stock- List Demo - Java Adapter](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-example-Stocklist-adapter-java) has to be deployed on your local Lightstreamer Server instance. Please check out that project and follow the installation instructions provided with it.
* Launch Lightstreamer Server.
* Get the `lightstreamer.min.js` file from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightstreamer-client-web) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/lightstreamer-client-web/lightstreamer.min.js) and put it in the `js` folder of the demo (if that is the case, please create it).
* From command line go into the `Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-electron` folder and run `npm install`.

The client demo configuration assumes that Lightstreamer Server, Lightstreamer Adapters, and this client are launched on the same machine. If you need to target a different Lightstreamer server, please search this line:
```js
var lsClient = new LightstreamerClient(protocolToUse+"//localhost:"+portToUse,"DEMO");
```
in `renderer.js` and change it accordingly.<br>

The demo is now ready to be launched with `npm start`.

## Build

To build the app by using [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/), run the command `npm run make`.

Electron Forge creates the `out` folder where your package will be located.
